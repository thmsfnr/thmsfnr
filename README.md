### Hi there! 👋

<strong>I am currently a last year student at Polytech Montpellier (a highly selective Engineering School
in the South of France), preparing a 5-year Engineering qualification in Computer Science and
Management (equivalent to a master’s degree in Engineering).</strong> 😊

Our qualification, a “diplôme d'ingénieur”, is fully recognized by the French National Engineering
Audit Commission (CTI) and classes in both theoretical and practical subjects prepare us for future
careers in a variety of domains related to Computer Science and Management, such as information
system design and analysis, software engineering, databases, programming languages, mobile and web
application development. 📚👨‍💼

As our school places much importance on education directly applied to professional experience,
each student completes a variety of work experience placements in firms throughout the course. 💼🎓

In parallel, I am developing an entrepreneurial project in a sector that is particularly important to me, namely finance and more particularly trading, and which consists of linking it to my computer science skills to set up a platform to help financial investment for individuals. 💡💰

From a more personal point of view, I like to challenge myself physically and mentally, which translates into the practice of many sports such as running, cycling and tennis, but also by more intellectual activities such as chess. Moreover, I like to debate, especially on economic or political subjects. 🏃‍♂️🚴‍♂️🎾♟️💬
